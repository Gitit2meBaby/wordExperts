      "I was under a tight deadline to finish a complex 20,000 word document for print. I made some last-minute tweaks to the table of contents, but all sorts of things went wrong - text appeared in the wrong places, pagination went out of whack, and I couldn't fix the problem myself. It was 4pm in Perth, 6pm in Sydney but I called Office Experts on the off chance they might be working late. Sure enough, I got both Rochelle and Scott, and within 30 minutes the problem was fixed and the document emailed back to me, neat and tidy and ready to PDF for the printer. I can certainly commend Office Experts for their advanced skills with Word and their quick turnaround time and attention to customer service.",
